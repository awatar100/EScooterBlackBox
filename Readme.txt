This project shall be data recorder for electrical scooter and other small personal devices. All data accusation is done to micro SD card. Main core is ESP32-cam module and 3 I2C sensors that gather information about magnetic fields, acceleration, angle, temperature and 4x voltage. 
Written in Arduino IDE. Current consumption in average is 23mA at 3,3V so it can be powered for long time by small lipo.
